# LncRBase-V.2
This second version of LncRBase contains information about lncRNAs from 8 species which includes human, mouse, fly, zebrafish, rat, chicken, C.elegans and cow and 5,49,368 unique lncRNA entries. 

I have developed LncRBase V.2 which serves as a valuable resource for the scientific community. The database was developed using PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL, and it has demonstrated its utility in advancing research in non-coding RNA biology.
